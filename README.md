# KieBot â€” Discord Bot for Torn City 
KieBot is a modular Discord bot with a primary focus on full integration with the **Torn City** game. It supports a **hybrid command system** (prefix `!` and forward slash `/`) for easy use, and leverages the **Torn City API** to provide relevant data directly to Discord. 

With features such as a comprehensive lottery system (Lotto), player ID management, automatic logging, and structured permission control, KieBot is designed to meet the needs of a dynamic and growing community. Its architecture is built using **ESM (ECMAScript Module)** and a folder structure that facilitates long-term development. 

KieBot was developed as an all-in-one bot foundation for Discord, with the goal of being a robust and reliable public bot solution, especially for the Torn City player community.
